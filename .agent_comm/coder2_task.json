Our study\ndemonstrates that flow matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO,\nwhile PSO provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This\nduality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel hybrid\nalgorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods. Although this\npaper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed correspondences suggest sev-\neral promising research directions, including improving swarm intelligence algorithms\nbased on flow matching principles and enhancing generative models using swarm intel-\nligence concepts.\nKeywords: Flow Matching; Particle Swarm Optimization; Generative Models; Evolu-\ntionary Computation\n1 Introduction\nComplex adaptive systems in nature exhibit remarkable capabilities of self-organization and\nemergent intelligence, spanning both physical and biological domains[1, 2, 3]. From the\nmolecular dynamics governing fluid flows to the collective behaviors of bird flocks and ant\n\u2217Corresponding author: oykc@mail.ustc.edu.cn\n1arXiv:2507.20810v1  [cs.NE]  28 Jul 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\ncolonies, these systems demonstrate how simple local interactions can generate sophisticated\nglobal patterns[4, 5, 6]. This rich tapestry of natural phenomena has inspired two major\nclasses of computational models in machine learning: generative models that emulate phys-\nical processes, and evolutionary computation that mimic biological adaptation[7, 8].\nGenerative models have successfully captured complex dynamics through mathemati-\ncal abstraction. Diffusion models simulate thermodynamic processes of particle diffusion\nand reversal[9], while flow matching methods directly learn the vector fields that govern\ncontinuous transformations between distributions[10]. These approaches share a common\nfoundation in modeling physical systems through differential equations, whether stochastic\n(as in diffusion processes) or deterministic (as in flow matching).\nConversely, evolutionary computation draws inspiration from biological complex adap-\ntive systems. Swarm intelligence algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO)[11],\nreplicate the emergent coordination observed in animal groups, where simple rules about lo-\ncal interactions and global information sharing lead to sophisticated optimization behaviors.\nSimilarly, evolutionary algorithms implement Darwinian principles of selection, recombina-\ntion, and mutation to solve complex problems through simulated evolution [12].\nDespite their shared roots in complex systems theory, these two paradigms\u2014generative\nmodels and evolutionary computation\u2014have developed largely independently. This paper\nbridges this divide by revealing fundamental connections between flow matching in generative\nmodeling[10] and particle swarm optimization in evolutionary computation[13]. We demon-\nstrate that these seemingly distinct approaches are in fact mathematical duals, with flow\nmatching representing a continuous generalization of PSO\u2019s discrete population dynamics.\nOur work makes three primary contributions: First, we establish mathematical equiv-\nalences between the vector fields in flow matching and the velocity update rules in PSO,\nshowing how both methods optimize population distributions through iterative updates (Sec-\ntion 3). Second, we demonstrate that the ordinary differential equation formulation of flow\nmatching provides a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing PSO dynamics, particu-\nlarly in understanding convergence properties. Third, we identify practical synergies between\nthe approaches, suggesting how flow matching\u2019s gradient information could enhance PSO\u2019s\noptimization capabilities while maintaining its population-based exploration advantages.\nThe significance of this unification extends beyond theoretical interest. Recent challenges\nin both fields\u2014such as mode collapse in generative models and premature convergence in evo-\nlutionary algorithms\u2014may find solutions through cross-pollination of ideas. For instance,\nthe continuous-time formulation of flow matching could help analyze and improve PSO\u2019s\nconvergence guarantees, while PSO\u2019s diversity maintenance mechanisms might address lim-\nitations in flow matching for multimodal distributions.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in both\ngenerative models and evolutionary computation. Section 3 presents our core theoretical\n2\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nanalysis connecting flow matching and PSO. Section 4 discusses implications and future\nresearch directions emerging from this connection. Our conclusions highlight how this unified\nperspective opens new possibilities for algorithm development in both fields.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Generative Models\nRecent advancements in generative models have revolutionized artificial intelligence, en-\nabling high-quality data synthesis across diverse domains. Two prominent approaches have\nemerged: diffusion models and flow matching models.\nDiffusion Models Diffusion models have established themselves as a powerful generative\napproach through iterative denoising processes. Key developments include Denoising Dif-\nfusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)[9], which laid the foundation for modern diffusion ap-\nproaches, and Score-based Generative Models (SGMs)[14] that formulate generation through\nstochastic differential equations. Recent innovations like Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)[15]\noperate in compressed latent spaces for improved computational efficiency, with Stable Dif-\nfusion becoming the most prominent open-source implementation for image generation.\nFlow Matching Models Flow matching models offer an alternative paradigm by learning\ndeterministic transformation paths. This category includes Continuous Normalizing Flows\n(CNF)[16] that utilize neural ODEs for density estimation, and Rectified Flows which en-\nhance efficiency through trajectory straightening[17]. The field has also seen Flow Matching\ntechniques employing simulation-free continuous objectives, as well as Optimal Transport\nFlow (OT-Flow) models that combine optimal transport theory with flow-based approaches[10].\nThese methods collectively provide efficient alternatives to traditional generative modeling\ntechniques.\n2.2 Evolutionary Computation\nEvolutionary computation techniques draw inspiration from biological evolution to address\ncomplex optimization challenges. Currently, two main approaches dominate the field: swarm\nintelligence algorithms that simulate collective behaviors of natural systems, and evolution-\nary algorithms that implement mechanisms of biological evolution.\nSwarm Intelligence Algorithms Swarm intelligence algorithms emulate collective be-\nhaviors observed in decentralized natural systems. Three foundational approaches include\n3\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO)[13], which pioneered the simulation of social behav-\nior in optimization; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)[18] that introduced pheromone-based\npathfinding for combinatorial problems; and the Firefly Algorithm (FA)[19] that established\nlight-intensity based attraction mechanisms for multimodal optimization.\nEvolutionary Algorithms Evolutionary Algorithms implement biological evolution mech-\nanisms for optimization. Three principal variants comprise Genetic Algorithms (GA)[20]\nfeaturing chromosome crossover and mutation operations; Differential Evolution (DE)[21]\nutilizing vector differences for efficient global optimization; and Covariance Matrix Adapta-\ntion Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)[22] representing state-of-the-art in evolutionary gradient\nestimation for continuous optimization.\n3 Flow Matching as Particle Swarm Optimization\nThe Flow Matching (FM) framework and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) share a pro-\nfound conceptual connection when viewed through the lens of population-based dynamics\nand vector-field-driven evolution. In FM, the initial noise distribution q(x0) (e.g., Gaussian)\ncan be analogized to the initial particle swarm population in PSO, where each particle\u2019s po-\nsition x0\niis sampled from a predefined domain. The fitness of particles in PSO corresponds\nto the negative log-likelihood of the data distribution p(x) in FM, guiding the optimization\ntoward high-probability regions.\nThe velocity update rule in PSO, defined as:\nvt+1\ni=wvt\ni+c1r1(pbesti\u2212xt\ni) +c2r2(gbest \u2212xt\ni),\nmirrors the role of the learned vector field vt(x) in FM, which deterministically transports\nparticles (or samples) from q(x0) top(x1). Here, pbestiandgbest act as local and global\nattractors, analogous to the conditional and marginal flow directions in FM that minimize\nthe KL divergence between the model and target distributions. The stochasticity intro-\nduced by r1, r2in PSO parallels the implicit randomness in FM\u2019s training objectives when\napproximating the vector field from finite data.\nThe convergence of PSO to an optimal solution distribution xT\ni\u223cp\u2217(x) aligns with FM\u2019s\nasymptotic goal: the final particle distribution p(x1) matches the target data distribution,\nwith higher fitness (likelihood) regions densely populated. This is achieved in FM through\nthe ODE:dxt\ndt=vt(xt),x0\u223cq(x0),\nwhere the continuous-time dynamics generalize PSO\u2019s discrete updates, replacing heuristic\nvelocity terms with a learned gradient flow. Notably, FM\u2019s deterministic trajectory construc-\n4\n\n--- Page 5 ---\ntion avoids PSO\u2019s risk of oscillatory convergence, while PSO\u2019s population-based exploration\noffers a stochastic counterpart to FM\u2019s density-driven interpolation.\nThe synergy between these frameworks suggests potential cross-pollination: FM could\nbenefit from PSO\u2019s multi-particle exploration for multimodal optimization, while PSO might\nadopt FM\u2019s continuous flow formalism to refine its convergence guarantees. This perspective\npositions FM as a gradient-aware, continuous-limit generalization of PSO, where the \u201dswarm\u201d\nevolves under a globally coherent vector field rather than local heuristic rules.\n4 Conclusion and Future Perspective\nThis paper has briefly revisited two distinct fields\u2014generative models and evolutionary com-\nputation\u2014and initiated an exploration of the potential connections between flow matching\nand particle swarm optimization. The preliminary analogies drawn here open several promis-\ning directions for future research. First, a comprehensive investigation of the mathematical\nduality between flow matching models and swarm intelligence algorithms could establish\ndirect theoretical links, potentially revealing deeper symmetries in their optimization mech-\nanisms. Second, interpreting flow matching models through the lens of swarm intelligence\nmay inspire novel algorithms, such as designing swarm-based methods where particle dy-\nnamics are governed by learned vector fields instead of heuristic rules. Third, a particularly\npromising direction lies in employing flow matching models to solve optimization problems,\nincluding both single-objective and multi-objective formulations, where the continuous-time\ndynamics could provide more efficient convergence properties compared to traditional evo-\nlutionary approaches. Fourth, revisiting the dynamical processes of swarm intelligence from\na flow matching perspective could allow these methods to be approximated as Markov pro-\ncesses guided by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), potentially leading to more rigorous\nconvergence analyses. Finally, a systematic review of the mathematical structures under-\nlying existing swarm and evolutionary algorithms, with fundamental classification based\non their ODE representations, could unify these approaches within a common theoretical\nframework. Such advancements would not only bridge the gap between these two fields but\nalso potentially yield new hybrid methods combining the strengths of both paradigms\u2014the\ngradient-aware continuous flows of modern generative models with the population-based\nexploration of bio-inspired optimization, particularly for complex optimization landscapes\nwhere current methods show limitations.\nReferences\n[1] John H Holland.
